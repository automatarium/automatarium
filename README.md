# 🌏 Automatarium

> A place for automata

Automatarium is a modern take on the useful [JFLAP](https://www.jflap.org/), but designed with a modern user interface and quality-of-life features that JFLAP was lacking. Currently, Automatarium fully supports finite automata, with basic  functionality implemented for push-down automata and Turing machines.

## Contributors

Automatarium is built primarily by [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/) students as a capstone project, created by the following students in 2022 (semester 1).

- [Max Reid](https://github.com/Prydeton)
- [Thomas Dib](https://github.com/tdib)
- [Ewan Breakey](https://github.com/giraugh)
- [Benji Grant](https://github.com/GRA0007)
