# 🌏 Automatarium

> A place for automata

Automatarium is a modern take on the useful [JFLAP](https://www.jflap.org/), but designed with a modern user interface and quality-of-life features that JFLAP was lacking. Currently, Automatarium fully supports finite automata, with basic  functionality implemented for push-down automata and Turing machines.
